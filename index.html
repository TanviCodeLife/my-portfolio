             <h2>Hello! Some fun facts about me.</h2>
                <p>I finished my MS in Electrical Engineering with a background of Control Engineering. I love gadgets and their inner workings. I have worked with 2 major companies where i worked with customers and understanding their design/engineering needs. These customer projects required aesthetically pleasing UIs and their robust databases.   </p>
                <p>With more customer facing roles and a break in career led me to explore other areas where i could utilise my skills. Web development immediately captured my attention and i started slowly with online tutorials.</p>
                <p>Here I am now, at Epicodus - coding day in and day out!</p>
                <p>Other than that i love dogs and working out. I am always up for a plank challenge!</p>
